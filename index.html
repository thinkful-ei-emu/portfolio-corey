        <h1>Hello, I am Corey, nice to meet you!</h1>

        <p>I have always been interested in computers from the time I was old enough to use a mouse and keyboard. 
            The first computer I was able to lay my hands on when I was 10 years old was a 486 dx2  with  80 MHz CPU and 16 MB RAM. 
            I used this machine to play a 2d tank shooting game. Technology has come along way since then and I have tried to keep up with it. 
            Within the past 6 years I have built, modified and performed hardware updates on 4 different computers. 
            Thinking about taking my computer knowledge to the next step and unlocking a new outlet for my love of computers landed me here. Writing code. </p>
